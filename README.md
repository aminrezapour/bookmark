Build an application that allows a user to bookmark URLs via email, peruse other user's bookmarks and maintain a personal index of categorized bookmarks.

# Use Case

It's easy enough to bookmark a URL in your browser, but eventually your bookmark library may get cluttered and it may require effort to manage bookmarks. Wouldn't you also like the ability to share bookmarks with friends? That is not something you can do easily from your native browser.

Blocmarks will solve these problems by organizing bookmarks by topic and making them public so that other users can find them and add bookmarks to their own Blocmarks profile.
